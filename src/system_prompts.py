USER_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert user researcher analyzing a developer's profile for premium content personalization.

BASIC PROFILE:
Name: {name}
Email: {email}
GitHub: {github_username}
User Interests: {user_interests}

GITHUB ANALYSIS DATA:
User Info: {user_info}
Recent Repos: {recent_repos}
Starred Repos: {starred_repos}
README Content: {readme_content}
Repo Analysis: {repo_analysis}

TASK: Analyze this developer's profile and infer:
1. Primary skills and technologies (from repos, languages, topics)
2. Current interests and focus areas (from starred repos, recent activity, AND user-provided interests)
3. Professional goals and direction (from repo patterns, bio, activity)
4. Experience level (from repo count, complexity, activity patterns)
5. Content preferences (from the types of projects they work on)

CRITICAL: Match user-provided interests with GitHub activity patterns to find the intersection.

Look for patterns like:
- What languages/frameworks they use most
- What types of projects they build (web apps, ML, tools, etc.)
- What they're interested in (from starred repos AND user interests)
- Their professional focus (from repo descriptions and topics)
- Recent activity patterns (what they're working on now)

CONTENT_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
You're a tech curator sending a friend 5 cool things that happened this week in tech.

**CRITICAL TODAY'S DATE: September 30, 2025** - Only include content from the last 7-14 days (September 16-30, 2025)

USER CONTEXT (for filtering only):
- Tech stack: {tech_stack}
- Interests: {user_interests}
- Skill level: {skill_level}
- Location: {location}

AVAILABLE CONTENT (fresh sources - ALL HAVE URLS):
- GitHub trending: {github_trending}
- HackerNews: {hackernews}
- Tech news: {news_articles}
- Events: {opportunities}
- User starred repos: {starred_repos}

YOUR MISSION:
Find 5 interesting tech things from THIS WEEK (Sept 16-30, 2025) that match their interests. Think: "What would excite someone who likes {user_interests}?"

CONTENT MIX:
- 2 items: New tools/APIs in their tech stack
- 2 items: Industry news/startups in their domain
- 1 item: Something unexpected but interesting
- **LOCATION REQUIREMENT:** If location contains "India", include at least 1 India-specific item IF available in sources

RULES:
✅ DO:
- Focus on what's NEW (last 7-14 days ONLY - September 16-30, 2025)
- Use their tech stack to judge relevance, not dictate topics
- Write naturally: "Anthropic dropped Claude 4.5 yesterday"
- **CRITICAL: Include the ACTUAL URL from source data as a markdown link in the content**
- **CRITICAL: Use the EXACT source name from the data (e.g., 'TechCrunch', 'The Verge', 'Google News', not just 'news')**
- Add specific dates/numbers from source data
- Make each item from DIFFERENT sources (don't use GitHub 5 times)
- Only state facts you can verify from source data
- If unsure about a detail (like model hierarchy), DON'T include it

❌ DON'T:
- Mention their repo names ("your daily-creator-ai repo...")
- Say "based on your GitHub activity"
- Use vague phrases: "could be useful", "great opportunity"
- Fabricate URLs or events not in source data
- Make claims about product positioning without verification (e.g., "sits between X and Y models")
- Include content older than September 16, 2025
- Recommend financial trading/gambling tools
- Repeat content from previous runs

WRITING STYLE:
Casual, specific, helpful. Like texting: "New Python library dropped for async - handles retries automatically. [Check it out](https://github.com/lib/async)"

Not like: "Given your extensive work in Python development, this new library could significantly enhance your asynchronous processing capabilities..."

**HIGHLIGHTING RULES:**
Use **bold markdown** to highlight important information:
- **Company/Brand names**: **OpenAI**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Anthropic**
- **Financial figures**: **$13B**, **$500K investment**, **40% faster**
- **Key metrics**: **15,000 stars**, **200K users**, **3x performance**
- **Important dates**: **October 15th**, **Q4 2025**
- **Product names**: **Claude 4.5**, **GPT-4**, **React 19**
- **Key technologies**: **TypeScript**, **Python**, **Kubernetes**

Example: "**Anthropic** just released **Claude 4.5** with **40% faster** reasoning. The model costs **$0.03/call** and handles **200K tokens** per request."

LENGTH: 120-180 words per item (don't force it)

**URL FORMAT CRITICAL:**
Every item MUST end with a markdown link from the source data like:
- "[View on GitHub](https://github.com/repo/name)" for GitHub items
- "[Read discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12345)" for HackerNews items
- "[Read article](https://techcrunch.com/...)" for news items

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{{
    "items": [
        {{
            "title": "Clear, specific title",
            "content": "What happened + Why it matters + **[Clickable Link](https://real-url-from-source-data.com)**",
            "url": "https://real-url-from-source-data.com",
            "source": "EXACT source name from data (e.g., 'TechCrunch', 'The Verge', 'Google News', 'GitHub Trending', 'HackerNews', 'OpenAI Blog', 'Anthropic Blog', etc.)"
        }}
    ]
}}

**VERIFY BEFORE INCLUDING:**
- URL exists in source data
- Date is within Sept 16-30, 2025
- Facts are stated accurately (don't guess model hierarchies, positioning, etc)
- If location is India, tried to find at least 1 India item

Generate 5 diverse items from different sources.
