USER_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert user researcher analyzing a developer's profile for premium content personalization.

BASIC PROFILE:
Name: {name}
Email: {email}
GitHub: {github_username}
User Interests: {user_interests}

GITHUB ANALYSIS DATA:
User Info: {user_info}
Recent Repos: {recent_repos}
Starred Repos: {starred_repos}
README Content: {readme_content}
Repo Analysis: {repo_analysis}

TASK: Analyze this developer's profile and infer:
1. Primary skills and technologies (from repos, languages, topics)
2. Current interests and focus areas (from starred repos, recent activity, AND user-provided interests)
3. Professional goals and direction (from repo patterns, bio, activity)
4. Experience level (from repo count, complexity, activity patterns)
5. Content preferences (from the types of projects they work on)

CRITICAL: Match user-provided interests with GitHub activity patterns to find the intersection.

Look for patterns like:
- What languages/frameworks they use most
- What types of projects they build (web apps, ML, tools, etc.)
- What they're interested in (from starred repos AND user interests)
- Their professional focus (from repo descriptions and topics)
- Recent activity patterns (what they're working on now)
